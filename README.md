## Description
This tool automatically pulls discussion attendance from Google Sheets and updates students' discussion assignment. The Google Sheet is the single source of truth. If discussion attendances were removed from Google Sheets, those changes will be reflected in Gradescope.

## Setup
Note: your Gradescope account must be an instructor for the course (not just have a TA or reader role).

1. Create a Gradescope **Homework/Problem Set** assignment
